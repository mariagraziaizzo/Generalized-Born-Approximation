# Generalized-Born-Approximation
The GBA_createDynStFac compute the dynamic structure factor and the related current both longitudinal and transverse as a function of wavector and frequency by the Generalized Born Approximation described in the papers 1) M. G. Izzo, B. Wehinger, S. Cazzato, A. Matic, C. Masciovecchio, A. Gessini, and G. Ruocco, 'Rayleigh scattering and disorder-induced mixing of polarizations in amorphous solids at the nanoscale: 1-octyl-3-methylimidazolium chloride glass', Phys. Rev. B 102, 214309 (2020); 2)  M. G. Izzo, G. Ruocco, and S. Cazzato, ‘The Mixing of Polarizations in the Acoustic Excitations of Disordered Media With Local Isotropy’ Front. Phys. 6, 108 (2018). The dynamic structure factors and currents including the bending of dispersion are also included (see Phys. Rev. B 102, 214309 (2020) and the Supplemental Material for details).
